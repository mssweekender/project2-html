                            The 80s was a decade of cultural transformation and
                            the expression of individuality. People were no
                            longer afraid to be who they were, and that
                            mentality was reflected in their fashion choices.
                            They like extravagant styles, bold colors, and
                            accessories were a must. Neon clothes and jumpsuits
                            were a thing, too. On the other hand, American
                            designers such as Perry Ellis and Ralph Lauren were
                            turning to a more classic and casual style with
                            the “preppy look”. Which was influenced by
                            traditional Ivy League and Seven Sisters Style, as
                            well as the dress of early  20th century British
                            aristocrats.
