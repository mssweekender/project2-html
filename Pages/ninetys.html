                            The three main subcultures of the 90s were Grunge
                            fashion pioneered by Marc Jacobs and Alexander
                            McQueen, (loose-fitting, worn-out jeans, flannel
                            shirts, Doc Martens, and chunky boots) the preppy
                            style, (oversized shirts, high-waisted jeans, plaid
                            mini-skirts) and Punk (black leather jackets, ripped
                            jeans, choker necklaces). In addition, women wore
                            overalls, swirl patterns, leopard print, scrunchies,
                            bandanas, crop tops, tie-dye… The beginning of the
                            1990s was the peak of the Supermodel era.

                    <h2>Totally Rad: A Blast From The 80's Fashion Past</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 1980s was a decade of excess, from hairspray to leg
                        warmers. Fashion mirrored this extravagance, with bold
                        colors, loud patterns, and statement pieces taking
                        center stage. Whether you craved comfort or craved
                        attention, 80s fashion had something for everyone.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        One of the defining trends of the era was the power
                        suit. Women embraced sharp tailoring and broad
                        shoulders, conveying a sense of confidence and ambition.
                        This look was popularized by TV shows like Dynasty and
                        Dallas, where working women ruled the boardroom in
                        style. Power dressing wasn't just for work, either.
                        Women incorporated tailored jackets and statement
                        blazers into their everyday wardrobes.

                        Beyond the Boardroom: Athletic Influences and Everyday
                        Style
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The 80s also saw a rise in athletic wear, thanks in part
                        to the aerobics craze. Leggings, leg warmers, and
                        brightly colored workout gear transitioned from the gym
                        to the streets. Daywear became more casual, with ripped
                        denim, mom jeans, and neon-colored t-shirts becoming
                        staples.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Men's fashion in the 80s was all about individuality.
                        Punk rock and new wave music influenced everyday style,
                        with ripped jeans, leather jackets, and graphic t-shirts
                        becoming popular choices. Preppy styles were also in,
                        featuring polo shirts, boat shoes, and pastel color
                        palettes. And of course, no look was complete without a
                        Members Only jacket.
